Hi, this is my first step in working int cloud security and I have completed a Capstone project on google cloud as well as achieving my certifcation. 


I will give a rundown on what I had achieved-
the scenario was protecting "Cymbal Bank" to mitigate data breaches, identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing security posture. 
1. I first used google cloud security command center to find the vulnerabilities 
2. Then, I shut the old VM while creating a new VM taken from the original stage before malware infection
3. I then fixed cloud storage permissions and removing "alluser" tag.
4. Fixing a firewall rule by deleting rules and enabling logging
5. Running a compliance report confirming vulnerablities issues have been mitigated. 
You have helped the security team at Cymbal Bank to mitigate the impact of the data breach, address the identified vulnerabilities, and significantly enhanced the security posture of Cymbal Bankâ€™s Google Cloud environment.
